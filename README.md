# Dashlit_studio
## About This Project
This project was created as the final capstone project for the Data Analytics and Engineering Bootcamp at Spiced Academy in December 2024, developed by Michael Luu and Benedict Reymann.

The goal of this project was to design a solution for aspiring data analysts who may join a company where licenses for BI tools are not yet available.

By utilizing sales and customer data stored as CSV files, along with a library of pre-built graph definitions for the most common sales, customer, and regional analyses, this project streamlines the process of generating meaningful results.

Analysts can focus on decision-making rather than repeatedly creating the same visualizations, making data-driven insights more accessible and efficient.
